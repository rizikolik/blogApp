# blogApp
A simple blog app that uses rest routes.


What I Used ?
1) RestFul Routes

2) CRUD operations

3)Taking data from the body of the form by Body-parser and req.body
and req.params.id 

4)Use the data from the body into the new items .

5)  "-"" sign in the ejs . So i could run the codes in the inputs .

6)Substring() method 

7)toDateString() method for transform time to handsome type

8)Method override(?_METHOD=...) because of html doesnt support the put request

9) Express-sanitizer for code inside the user inputs
