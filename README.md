A simple blog app that uses rest routes.

* CRUD operations
*Taking data from the body of the form by Body-parser and req.body
and req.params.id 
*Use the data from the body into the new items .
* - sign in the ejs . So i could run the codes in the inputs .
*Substring() method 
*toDateString() method for transform time to handsome type
